# Data Plus Dao
## Goal
With the current Filecoin data onboarding design, the Fil plus deal gives all the storage providers the same output while the storage cost is regionally variable. Currently, Fil plus data is stored unbalanced in different regions, the storage provider isn’t incentive enough to move the data to other regions due to the high bandwidth transfer cost. Data Plus Dao is aiming at solving the data regionally availability, accessibility, retrieval, and governance.

•	Cover bandwidth cost between different regions
•	Data availability in different regions
•	Balance cost and revenue in vendors
•	Investment and governance
•	Token benefits
